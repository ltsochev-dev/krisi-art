# `next build` inlines every `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` read into the bundle it
# emits, so these have to be present HERE — the runtime `.env` on the VPS is far
# too late, and an unset one silently bakes in `undefined`. That makes the image
# environment-specific: a tag built with a staging token cannot be promoted to
# production. The values are served to browsers verbatim, so nothing secret
# belongs in them. Declared after `COPY . .` so changing one only invalidates
# the build layer, not the dependency install.
